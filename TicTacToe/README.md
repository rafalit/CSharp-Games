# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It allows players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, with visual feedback and a clear indication of game outcomes.

## Features
* Interactive Gameplay: Players can make moves by clicking on the cells of the grid.
* Visual Feedback: The game provides visual feedback for each move, highlighting the current player and marking the cells accordingly.
* Game Over Detection: The game detects when a player wins, loses, or when it's a tie.
* End Game Animation: When the game ends, an animation shows the winning line or indicates a tie before displaying the result.
* Restart Functionality: Players can restart the game after it ends to play again.
## Requirements
* Windows OS: The application is built using WPF, which is a Windows-only technology.
* .NET Framework: This project requires the .NET Framework to run. Ensure that you have the appropriate version installed.
