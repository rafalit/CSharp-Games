# Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).

## Overview
The Snake game consists of controlling a snake on a grid. The snake moves continuously, and the player's objective is to guide the snake to eat food that appears on the grid, thereby growing longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the grid.

#### Features
* Grid Setup: The game grid is set up using WPF's UniformGrid, allowing for easy management and visualization of the game state.
* Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right, based on user input.
* Food Generation: Food randomly appears on the grid for the snake to eat. Upon eating food, the snake grows longer, and the player's score increases.
* Game Over Handling: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the grid boundaries. A game over message is displayed, allowing the player to restart the game.
#### Instructions
* Starting the Game: Press any arrow key to start the game.
* Controlling the Snake: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
* Scoring: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food.
* Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the grid boundaries. Press any key to restart the game.
#### Technologies Used
* C#: The primary programming language used for game logic and backend development.
* WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): Used for creating the user interface and managing visual elements.
* XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language): Used for designing the layout of the game window.
